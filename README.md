Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2019

Code is tested with Python 3.6.6 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10. Developed with VSCode.

## Days

* Day 1:  Easy looping through a list.
* Day 2:  Introduced an "Intcode" program, with addition/multiplication/halt operations.  I suspect that this will be expanded upon in the future.  Needed deepcopy.  Times:  00:17:40 / 00:31:12.  Ranks:  1286 / 1382.
* Day 3:  Instructions to walk on a grid.  Didn't complete part 2 yet.
