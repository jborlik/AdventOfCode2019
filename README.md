# AdventOfCode2019

Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2019

Code is tested with Python 3.6.6 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10. Developed with VSCode.

## Days

* Day 1:  Easy looping through a list.
* Day 2:  Introduced an "Intcode" program, with addition/multiplication/halt operations.  I suspect that this will be expanded upon in the future.  Needed deepcopy.
